<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  This site was created to replace the Serenity Games home page and to give members
  a way to connect with each other. It is meant to be easily
  maintainable, portable, and secure.
</p>

<h4>What about the forums?</h4>
<p>
  The forums have been taken down due to lack of use. phpBB takes quite a bit of
  time to maintain and it is no longer worth the time or effort.
  <a class='user' href='/{{ 'tjbenator' | datapage_url: 'user' }}' style='color: #F55;'>tjbenator</a>
  may take the time some day to generate a static version of the forums.
